**Modulation of auditory gamma-band responses using transcranial electrical stimulation**

Noninvasive brain stimulation is used across clinical, commercial, and research applications to change the brain in the hopes of changing behavior, yet how it affects brain activity are not well understood. Using scalp EEG, we delineated how two common brain stimulation techniques, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), affect auditory gamma responses in healthy adults. Whereas gamma frequency-tuned tACS adjusts the magnitude and timing of auditory gamma responses, both tACS and tDCS strengthen the gamma phase connectome, which is disrupted in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. On the [Scientific Sense podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vSHPWhUwWY), we discussed how these findings can be leveraged to combat cognitive decline in the elderly.
