## Modulation of auditory gamma-band responses using transcranial electrical stimulation

Noninvasive brain stimulation is used across clinical, commercial, and research applications to change the brain in hopes of changing behavior, yet we don't fully understand how it changes brain activity. Using scalp EEG, we delineate how two common brain stimulation techniques, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), affect auditory gamma responses in healthy adults. Whereas gamma frequency-tuned tACS adjusts the magnitude and timing of auditory gamma responses, both tACS and tDCS strengthen the gamma phase connectome, which is disrupted in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders and may be a target for intervention. 

Our research aims to uncover mechanistic explanations of the neural basis of human behavior, that is, move from where to how. Our goals are multifaceted: (1) advance fundamental science by discovering new knowledge using rigorous, reproducible methods; and (2) advance translational applications in neurotechnology, precision medicine, and product development that are grounded in rigorous science. In this project, we showcase how applying a repertoire of analytics - spanning signal processing, graph theory, and nonparametric statistics - to neurophysiological data can inform the design of therapeutic brain stimulation protocols. On the [Scientific Sense podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vSHPWhUwWY), we discussed ways to leverage these findings to combat cognitive decline in the elderly.
